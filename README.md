# discordBot2
Discord bot that interacts with a database and allows users to play minigames.
This bot was coded using javasscript and node.js, it allows user to use a currency system and keeps up to date using a database.
This is a solo project meant to help others with some normal walls they may encounter while coding a bot, such as creating dynamic menus, updating data and managing many users at once.
